Similar to Bird, FRR is a routing daemon for Linux. It can be used to announce an elastic IP address via BGP from the instance that is currently using it.

### Getting Started

If you haven't already requested that BGP be added to your account you'll need to get that sorted before continuing with this guide - see more info about getting started [here](https://www.packet.com/developers/docs/network/advanced/local-and-global-bgp).

### Choose an IP to Broadcast

Navigate over to **IPs & Networks** in your BGP enabled project and click on _Manage Block_ for the IPv4 block in the data center location that corresponds with your server deployment. Choose an available IP that will act as your broadcast IP. In this guide, we'll be using 10.99.200.138.

### Update Network Interface

Update the network interfaces with a virtual loopback interface.

```bash
cat >>/etc/network/interfaces <<EOF
auto lo:0
iface lo:0 inet static
  address 10.99.200.138
  netmask 255.255.255.255
EOF
```

### Bring Up the Interface

```bash
ifup lo:0
```

### Configuration

First install system dependencies. On Ubuntu 18.04 this looks like:

```bash
apt -y update && apt -y install python3.6 python3-pip git libpcre3-dev apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl wget logrotate libc-ares2 libjson-c3 vim systemd procps libreadline7 gnupg2 lsb-release apt-utils
```

Add FRR's apt signing key and configure the FRR repo:

```bash
curl -s https://deb.frrouting.org/frr/keys.asc | apt-key add - && \
    echo deb https://deb.frrouting.org/frr $(lsb_release -s -c) frr-stable | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/frr.list
```

Now install FRR:

```bash
apt -y update && apt -y install frr frr-pythontools
```

Once installed, we need to enable BGP wiithin FRR's configuration:

```bash
sed -i "s/^bgpd=no/bgpd=yes/" /etc/frr/daemons
```

Now we need to clone the network-helpers repo and install python dependencies:

```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/packethost/network-helpers.git
cd network-helpers
pip3 install jmespath
pip3 install -e .
```

And then apply the FRR configuration using our instance's metadata:

```
./configure.py -r frr | tee /etc/frr/frr.conf
frr defaults traditional
log syslog informational
ipv6 forwarding
service integrated-vtysh-config
!
!
router bgp 65000
 bgp ebgp-requires-policy
 neighbor V4 peer-group
 neighbor V4 remote-as 65530
 neighbor V4 password somepassword
 neighbor 10.99.182.128 peer-group V4
 neighbor V6 peer-group
 neighbor V6 remote-as 65530
 neighbor V6 password somepassword
 neighbor 2604:1380:1:5f00:: peer-group V6
 !
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  redistribute connected
  neighbor V4 route-map IMPORT in
  neighbor V4 route-map EXPORT out
 exit-address-family
 !
 address-family ipv6 unicast
  redistribute connected
  neighbor V6 activate
  neighbor V6 route-map IMPORT in
  neighbor V6 route-map EXPORT out
 exit-address-family
 !
route-map EXPORT deny 100
!
route-map EXPORT permit 1
 match interface lo
!
route-map IMPORT deny 1
!
line vty
!
```

Lastly, we'll restart FRR:

```bash
systemctl restart frr
```

And then verify our bgp session is up and our desired prefix is being advertised:

```
vtysh

Total number of prefixes 1
```

In this case we only have a single elastic IP bound to interface lo, and we see the prefix is being exported and accepted so we are done.

To test, you can ping the IP address in a command line - `ping 10.99.200.138`. _Remember, Local BGP is announcing a private IP address, so you'll have to be connected to the private network for the data center you're running Local BGP in. You can do that by SSHing into another server in that data center or by connected to [Doorman](https://www.packet.com/developers/docs/network/basic/doorman), Packet's private VPN._

**Congratulations! You've just configured a BGP routing protocol.**

#### Alternative Method

For those interested, FRR can also be automatically deployed via docker. See more [here](https://github.com/packethost/network-helpers/blob/master/routers/frr/README.md#method-2-frr-via-docker).
